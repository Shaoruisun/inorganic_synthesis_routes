Experimental2.1. Catalyst preparationThe ZnO support was prepared by the thermal decomposition of zinc oxalate (ZnC2O42H2O) according to theprocedure described by Cubeiro and Fierro [21]. In brief,zinc oxalate was precipitated at 60 8C from a solution of zincnitrate hexahydrate (Aldrich, 98%) by the dropwise additionof oxalic acid dihydrate (Aldrich, 99.9%). Oxalic acid wasadded in 20% excess to ensure complete precipitation. Theprecipitate was aged for 1 h then washed, filtered and driedin a vacuum oven for 12 h at 80 8C. The solid product wascalcined at 145 8C in air flowing at 100 ml/min for 30 min.The temperature was increased to 380 8C at a rate of 5 8C/min and held at this temperature for 30 min. Completeconversion to ZnO was ensured by further increasing thetemperature to 400 8C and holding it there for 4 h. The CeO2support was prepared via thermal decomposition of ceriumoxalate. The oxalate was prepared from the reaction ofcerium nitrate and oxalic acid. Subsequently, the ceriumoxalate was dried and calcined following the same procedureused for the preparation of ZnO. A series of catalysts with Pdloadings ranging from 2–10 wt.% were prepared by a wetimpregnation technique using an aqueous solution ofPd(NO3)22H2O (Fluka, purum grade). The stirred solutionwas kept at 40 8C for 30 min, and then the temperature wasslowly increased to 60 8C and maintained there for another30 min. The temperature was increased to 80 8C and heldthere for 60 min with stirring. The hot solution was thenfiltered and the resulting solids were vacuum dried at 80 8Covernight and calcined at 500 8C in air flowing at 100 ml/min for 5 h .  
2. Experimental A series of Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared from impregnating aqueous Pd(NO3)2 solution containing 20.19 wt.% Pd (Engelhard) onto ZnO powder (Aldrich, 99%) using a solution/solid ratio of 0.58 ml/g. The nominal Pd concentrations in the samples prepared are 4.8, 9.0, and 16.7 wt.%. The impregnated samples were dried under vacuum at 110 ◦C for at least 8 h prior to calcining in air. Unless otherwise mentioned, the calcination was conducted under a 2 ◦C/min ramp followed by holding isothermally at 350 ◦C for 3 h.
2. Experimental procedure Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared by impregnating aqueous Pd(NO3)2 solution (Engelhard, 20.19 wt.% Pd) onto ZnO (Aldrich, 99+%), previously calcined at 700 jC, unless mentioned otherwise. Several other reference samples were prepared by impregnating nitric acid onto ZnO. The impregnated samples were dried under vacuum at 110 jC for at least 8 h prior to calcining in air. The calcinations were conducted under a 2 jC/min ramp followed by holding isothermally at 350 jC for 3 h.
2. ExperimentalSupported Pd catalysts were prepared by impregnation of an aqueous solutionof palladium nitrate on various metal oxides, i.e. SiO2 (Nihon Chromato KogyoLtd.), A1203 (Catalysis Society of Japan JRC-ALO4), La203 (Wako Pure Chemicals Ltd., extra pure grade), Nb2Os (Wako Pure Chemicals Ltd., extra pure grade), N d 2 0 3 (Wako Pure Chemicals Ltd., extra pure grade), ZrO2 which was preparedby thermal decomposition of zirconium oxynitrate (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.,extra pure grade), ZnO (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., extra pure grade), in a rotaryevaporator at 353 K. The catalysts thus prepared were dried at 383 K overnightandcalcined in air at 773 K for 3 h. Unless otherwise stated, Pd loading was kept at 1wt% over these metal oxides. For comparison, and unsupported Pd catalystderivedfrom palladium black was also used for the reaction. Experimentswere carried out at atmospheric pressure in a fashion similar to that in the previous work[4]. A conventional flow reactor was used. The inlet partial pressures of methanoland water were both kept at 24.3 kPa unless otherwise stated. Residence time wasvaried in a range covering from 0.23 to 3.29 s. Nitrogen was used as a diluent.Gaseous components in the effluent were analyzed by gas chromatography.The selectivity for the steam reforming was evaluated on the carbon basis, i.e.Pco2/(Pco2 + Pco + 2PcH3OCH3),where Pco2, Pco and PCH3OCH3represent thepartial pressures of CO2, CO and CH3OCH3, respectively. The number of surfacePd atoms was determinedby the adsorption of hydrogen at 373 K [9]. The dispersion of Pd was estimated from the ratio of the number of surface Pd atoms to thetotal number of Pd atoms used for the catalysts.
The Pd/In2O3 powder catalyst was prepared via impregnation ofIn2O3 powder with small Pd particles. For this purpose, In2O3powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%, BET surface area 1 m2/g) was dispersedin ~150 ml distilled water and the Pd precursor (Pd(NO3)2 99.95%,metals basis, 12% Pd) was slowly added under permanent vigorousstirring. Finally, the water was evaporated and the resultingcatalyst subjected to an oxidative treatment in air at 873 K for 1 h.This procedure converts the catalyst into PdO/In2O3, as verified byroutine X-ray diffraction measurements. Reductive (1 bar H2 for 1 h), oxidative (1 bar O2 for 1 h) andtempering treatments in He (1 bar) were performed in parallel in acirculating batch reactor in the temperature range between 373 Kand 773 K.
2.1. Catalysts Preparation. Two series of Pd/ZnOcatalysts were prepared using a commercial ZnO prism(ZnO-P, Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) without dominant facets anda needlelike ZnO (ZnO-N) with predominantly exposednonpolar facets, that is, (10-10). The ZnO needles weresynthesized using a PVP assisted alcohol thermal procedureaccording to a previously reported method34 with somemodifications. In a typical synthesis, 3 g of PVP (SigmaAldrich; M = 40 000) was dissolved in 180 mL of ethanol (200proof), and then 0.75 g of zinc acetate dihydrate (SigmaAldrich, reagent grade) was slowly added into the solution. Theresulting mixture was stirred for several minutes, followed byaddition of 4.5 g of NaOH. A turbid solution resulted and wasstirred for another 2 h. The above solution was loaded andsealed into an autoclave, which was kept at 80 °C for 24 h.Then, the sample was filtered and washed with ethanol anddistilled water several times. Finally, the precipitate was dried toobtain the as-synthesized ZnO-N. PVP could be still observedsurrounding some of the particles by TEM, even after repeatedethanol and water washes (Supporting Information Figure S1).However, PVP could be removed completely after calcinationat 350 °C for 3 h. To prevent the ZnO surface structure6 from being affectedby chemically active precursors such as nitrates, the catalystswere prepared by impregnating the ZnO support withpalladium II acetate salt (>99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved inacetone, followed by drying at 80 °C for 8 h and calcined at 350°C for 3 h. For each series, the Pd loading amount (wt %) wasvaried between 1% and 9.1%.
Pd/C was prepared by the impregnation of carbon black(Cabot Specialty Chemicals Inc., VULCAN P, BET surfacearea:140m2g-1) with an acetone solution of Pd(C5H7O2)2(SOEKAWA CHEMICALS, >99%). After the removal ofthe acetone solvent, the catalyst was dried in air at 383 K for12 h. Loading amount of Pd was 2 wt.%. The addition of Znto Pd/C was carried out by the impregnation of Pd/C withan acetone solution of Zn(C5H7O2)2 ·H2O (SOEKAWACHEMICALS, >99%), then dried in air at 383 K for 12 h.The molar ratio of Zn to Pd was 3. The Pd/ZnO catalyst(Pd loading: 2 wt.%) was prepared by impregnation of ZnO(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., BET surface area:4 m2 g-1) with an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 (N.E.CHEMCAT), followed by drying at 383 K for 12 h; the material was then calcined in air at 773 K for 3 h. The Pd/ZnOcatalyst was prepared on the basis of the previous report[14]. These catalysts were reduced in pure H2 at 673 K for1 h before each activity test in the catalyst bed.
A co-precipitation method was used to prepare thePdZrZn catalyst. In a typical synthesis, calculatedamounts of palladium nitrate dihydrate (0.075 g), zirconiumnitrate pentahydrate (1.41 g) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate(5.48 g) were dissolved in 300 mL of ultrapure water. Themixture was dispersed with an ultrasonic dispersion instrument for 2 h at 40 C and stirred (800 rpm) vigorously witha mechanical stirrer for 2 h at 40 C. Subsequently, anaqueous solution containing potassium hydroxide(0.5 mol L1) and potassium carbonate (0.2 mol L1) wasslowly added into the above solution until the pH measuredby a pH meter (Mettler Toledo FE20) reached 8.5. The slurrywas stirred continuously for 48 h at 40 C, then filtered by aBu¨ chner funnel, and washed thoroughly with ultrapurewater (500 mL  5). The resulting precipitate was dried at100 C overnight in an oven and calcined at 400 C with aheating rate of 5 C$min1 in a stationary air for 4 h to achievethe PdZrZn catalyst. The Nb-doped PdZrZn catalystswith different Nb mass loadings were prepared by impregnating uncalcined PdZrZn sample (100 mesh) with acalculated amount of aqueous solution of niobium oxalate.After impregnation, the slurry was evaporated to dry byheating and stirring at 50 C using a magnetic heated stirrer.Next, the resulting precursor underwent drying at 100 Covernight and calcination at 400 C with a heating rate of5 C$min1 for 4 h to obtain the Nb-modified PdZrZn catalysts. The prepared Nb-modified PdZrZn catalysts wereidentified as xNb/PdZrZn, in which x referred to thenominal weight percentage of niobium on the ZnO support.In the case of Nb-modified and unmodified PdZrZn catalysts, the nominal mass loading of Pd and Zr on the ZnOsupport were fixed at 2 wt% and 20 wt%, respectively. Forcomparison, the PdZn and PdZr catalysts, both with 2 wt%loading amount of Pd, were also prepared by a coprecipitation method using the aforementioned procedure.Finally, all the prepared Pd-based catalysts were ground intopowder (100 mesh) and pressed to form granules with sizesof 40-60 meshes.
The Pd/Ga2O3 powder catalyst was prepared by a standardincipient wetness technique. Ga2O3 powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%)was dispersed in 150 ml distilled water and the Pd precursor(Pd(NO3)2 99.95%, metals basis, 12% Pd) was slowly added underpermanent vigorous stirring. Finally, the water was evaporatedand the resulting catalyst subjected to an oxidative treatment in airat 873 K for 1 h. This procedure converts the catalyst into PdO/Ga2O3, as verified by routine X-ray diffraction measurements. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (performed at 300 K with aThermo MultiLab 2000 spectrometer equipped with a Mg/Alstandard twin anode X-ray source using Al Ka radiation) was usedto check the purity of these samples, but only showed peaks due toPd, Ga and O with contaminants below the detection limit. Reductive (1 bar H2 for 1 h), oxidative (1 bar O2 for 1 h) andtempering treatments in He (1 bar) were performed in parallel in acirculating batch reactor in the temperature range between 373and 773 K.
For a direct comparison between aerogel-based materials withconventionally impregnated materials in the literature,26 theaerogel was synthesized with a composition of 8 wt % Pd/In2O3 (by ICP/OES).
Thin film GaPd2 was prepared by alternating layer deposition ofPd and Ga in a PVD-dedicated HV apparatus [10]. The film wasdeposited at 573 K onto a Ta metal sheet (18  20  0.125 mm),which was pre-cleaned with abrasive paper and cleaned in boilinghot water and hot ethanol. To stimulate the formation of theintermetallic compound, the alternating layer setup was chosento induce preliminary intermixing of the Pd and Ga layers. Pd and Ga were both thermally evaporated from either a W crucible(Pd) or a Ta crucible (Ga) in a background pressure of 5  106 -mbar. To prepare the GaPd2 film, in sum 21 layers at a mass ratio Ga:Pd = 1:3.1, corresponding to an atomic ratio of 1:2, were deposited. Start and end layers were half of a Pd layer. Subsequently, theGaPd2 film was transferred to the UHV chamber and post-annealedat 673 K. Surface composition and cleanliness of the sample werechecked by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy ionscattering (LEIS), confirming a clean surface after a mild sputter–anneal cycle sufficient to remove ambient-induced carbonaceousdeposits. The resulting film had a thickness of 400 nm. 
Catalysts used were Pd/ZnO ( 10 wt.-% Pd), Pd/ZrO2 ( 10 wt.-% Pal), Pd/SiO2( 10 wt.-% Pd) and unsupported palladium. Pd/ZnO was prepared by impregnationof ZnO ( Kanto Chemicals Co. ) with a solution of palladium nitrate (Tanaka NobleMetals Co.) at 353 K. Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/SiO2 were obtained in a manner similar tothat of the preparation of Pd/ZnO. ZrO2 was prepared by decomposition of zirconyloxynitrate (Kishida Chemicals Co.) at 773 K for 3 h in air. SiO2 was purchasedfrom Nihon Chromato Co. The unsupported palladium was prepared by decomposition of palladium nitrate at 773 K in air for 3 h. The catalyst samples thus obtained were dried at 383 K overnight and calcinedat 773 K for 3 h in air. The samples were then packed in a conventional flow reactor,and again calcined at 773 K for 2 h in a stream of O2/He (20 vol.-% 02) at a totalflow-rate of 100 cm3/min. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were reduced in a hydrogen stream (4 vol.-%H2) diluted with helium under temperature-programmed conditions with a heatingrate of 5 K/min up to the given temperatures. The total flow-rate was kept at 100cm3/min.
The preparation of the catalyst films was outlined indetail in part I [6]. Pd particles were grown by electronbeam deposition on in-situ deposited NaCl films (37 cm2each) at around 623 K and subsequently covered with a film of amorphous Ga2O3 by reactive deposition of thermally evaporated β-Ga2O3 in 10-2 Pa O2 at either 300 K or600 K (thickness of the support 25 nm each). All films used for catalytic experiments were subsequently covered by alayer of amorphous SiO2 (prepared by reactive deposition of SiO in 10-2 Pa O2 at 300 K) to improve the mechanical stability (mean SiO2 thickness 1000 nm). The films were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water, dried and finally mounted on quartz wool inside the reactor. The Pd/Ga2O3powder samples were prepared following a standard incipient wetness routine followed by calcination in air at 873K for 1h.
In this work, the ZnZrOx composite oxide with designed bulk atomic ratio of Zn:Zr as 1:1 was prepared by the carbon hard-template method [46]. Details of the synthesis procedure was published in a previous report [42]. In brief, an aqueous solution of the desired amounts of nitrates of zinc and zirconium was impregnated onto the carbon black template. The carbon template was then combusted off at 550 °C in air, leaving only the composite metal oxide Zn1Zr1Ox. For comparison, pure ZnO and ZrO2 were also prepared following the same procedure. Addition of palladium to the metal oxides was conducted by incipient wetness impregnation. Aqueous solution of palladium nitrate (Alfa Aesar, Pd(NO3)2•xH2O, Pd 39%) with the same volume as the pore volume of the metal oxide was impregnated to the support. Palladium loading was designed to be 1 wt.% of each metal oxide support. Impregnated samples were dried at 80 °C for 8 h under vacuum to enhance the uptake of palladium precursors into the porous structure of the metal oxide support. Calcination of the dried samples was performed in air at 400 °C for 4 h (denoted with suffix -P). Reduction of Pd catalysts was conducted in flowing H2 at either 200 or 400 °C (denoted with suffix -R200 or -R400, respectively) for 2 h to facilitate the formation of PdZn alloy. The catalyst after reaction is denoted as Pd/Zn1Zr1Ox-SRM. Sample notations with their corresponding treatment conditions are listed in Table 1. 
Preparation of Catalysts of Pd/m-ZnO and Pd/ZnO. The deposition-precipitation method was employed for the preparation of 2 wt % Pd/m-ZnO catalyst. Briefly, m-ZnO powder and H2PdCl6 (3.75 × 10-2 mol/L) solution were mixed to yield a suspension, and then Na2CO3 (0.6-0.7 mol/L) was slowly added to the suspension under vigorous stirring until the pH level was 10. After the solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, the resulting product was filtered off, washed with deionized water several times to remove Cl-, CO32-, and Na+, dried in an oven overnight, and then calcined in air under static conditions at 673 K for 2 h. To compare the catalytic performance, the 2 wt % Pd/ZnO catalyst was also synthesized on a non-mesoporous ZnO support under the same preparation conditions demonstrated in the preparation of the Pd/m-ZnO catalyst.
 We prepared Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts by an incipient wetness technique. The Al2O3 was first prepared by calcining boehmite (Sasol) at 850 ºC for 5h. A solution of Pd and Zn nitrates (Pd/Zn molar ratio = 0.38) was added drop wise to the Al2O3 and the mixture was shaken to ensure even distribution of the nitrate precursor. This was followed by drying at 80ºC, and the process was repeated until 8.8 wt%. Pd was achieved. The dried catalyst is designated “as-prepared”.
The labelling of different oxides will be referred as ZrO2, TiO2 and ZTn, where Z = ZrO2, T = TiO2, n = 50 mol% of TiO2 in mixed oxide respectively. Palladium (around 1 wt.%) was incorporated on the supports by classical impregnation using an aqueous solution of PdCl2 (Aldrich). After drying, the catalysts were calcined in air at 400 C for 2 h, and then, the samples were reduced in H2(5%)/He (40 mL/min) at 300 C for 1 h.
The catalysts used in this study were simple supported Pd and modified supported Pd catalysts. The simple supported Pd catalysts were prepared by impregnation of a solution of palladium nitrate with various supports, such as ZnO (source, Kanto Chemical; purity from supplier, 99.0%), Ga2O3 (Kishida Chemical, 99.99%), In2O3 (Wako Pure Chemical, 99.9%), SiO2 (GL Sciences, 99.0%), Al2O3 (Catalysis Society of Japan, 99.9%), Pr6O11 (Wako Pure Chemical, 99.9%), MgO, ZrO2, CeO2 and active carbon (AC; Takeda Chemical, 99%) at 353 K. MgO, ZrO2 and CeO2 were prepared after the calcinations of Mg(OH)2, ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O, and Ce2(CO3)3·nH2O, respectively, in air at 773 K for 3 h. The modified supported Pd catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation of a mixture of palladium nitrate and a metal salt such as Zn, In, Ga, Cd, Pb, Sn or Cu on various supports. Pd loading of each catalyst was kept at 10 wt.% unless otherwise stated. The Zn-modified Pd/CeO2 catalysts were also prepared by co-precipitation and deposition–precipitation methods. The catalysts thus prepared were subjected to calcination in air at 773 K for 3 h. The catalyst (1.0 g) was then packed in a reactor and calcined again at 773 K for 2 h in a stream of O2 (20 vol.% O2) diluted with nitrogen. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in a hydrogen stream (4 vol.% H2) diluted with nitrogen under temperature-programmed conditions at a heating rate of 5 K min-1 up to 773 K.
The catalysts used were several Group 8–10 metals, such as Co, Ni, Ru, Pd, Ir and Pt, supported on various metal oxides i.e. ZnO, In2O3; Ga2O3; SiO2; MgO; ZrO2; CeO2; Al2O3; active carbon (AC), Ta2O5 and HfO2: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the metal oxides with a solution of the corresponding metal salts at 353 K. For comparison, Cu/ZnO was also prepared by an impregnation method with a solution of CuðNO3Þ2 and ZnO. Metal loading of each catalyst was kept at 10 wt% unless otherwise stated. The catalysts thus prepared were then dried at 383 K overnight, pressed into granules in sizes of 60–80 meshes (Tyler meshes), and were subjected to calcination in air at 773 K for 3 h. The catalysts (1.0 g) were then packed in a reactor and calcined again at 773 K for 2 h in a stream of O2 (20 vol% O2) diluted with nitrogen at a total flow rate of 100 cm3 STP/min. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were reduced in a hydrogen stream (4 vol% H2) diluted with nitrogen under temperature-programmed conditions at a heating rate of 5 K/min. The reduction temperatures of the supported Group 8–10 metals and Cu/ZnO catalysts were 773 and 523 K, respectively.
A set of supported Pd catalysts was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, at room temperature, of acetone-diluted Pd(AcO)2 (Sigma 99.97% Pd) onto pure zinc(II) and cerium(IV) oxides, as well as composites of both oxides containing different Zn/Ce = 0.5, 1 and 2 at/at ratios. The supports were synthesized using two alternate co-precipitation routes designated as OC (oxalates coprecipitation) and CC (carbonates coprecipitation), with further drying and calcining in each case. The obtained materials were labeled indicating the preparation method (OC or CC), metal cation(s) and/or Zn/Ce atomic ratio (Ce, Zn, ZnCe). For comparison purposes – and economic reasons as well-, a third (conventional) type of composite support, in which ZnO was incorporated onto ceria (ex-oxalate, that is, derived from the oxalate precursor) by incipient wetness, was also included. In this last case, two different ZnO nominal coverages were used ( = 0.4 and 1), which correspond to 3.5 and 11 wt% ZnO loadings, and were designated as IO–CeZn04 and IO–CeZn1, respectively. Approximately 2 wt% Pd was added to the OC and CC support series, while only 1 wt% Pd was incorporated to the IO supports instead. After vacuum drying (333 K, 2 h), the impregnated precursors were calcined in a glass reactor using synthetic air (from 298 to 673 K with ˇ = 3 K min-1) at 673 K for 2 h.
A Pd-promoted Cu-based catalysts was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the CuZn catalyst prepared as shown above, using Pd(NO3)2 × 2H2O dissolved in deionized water. The resulting material was dried overnight at 393 K and calcined in flowing air at 573 K for 6 h. The Pd-content was 0.7%, and the catalyst is termed 0.7Pd/CuZn. A Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (Pd content 1 wt%) was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of a -Al2O3 support followed by drying and calcinations in the same way as described above. This catalyst was termed Pd/Al2O3.
To prepare the inverse Pd-Zr model systems, zirconium (IV) tert-butoxide Zr(O-t-C4H9)4 (Sigma-Aldrich, purity: 99,999%) is used as ALD/CVD precursor. Prior to dosing ZTB, several cycles of freeze-and-thaw are performed (cooling temperature: 77 K, freezing point ZTB: 269 K). ZTB has a sufficient vapor pressure at room temperature to dose it directly through a leak-valve. Before sample exposure, the preparation chamber is exposed to the precursor at 5 × 10-7 mbar for 5 min to passivate the chamber walls against precursor decomposition. The exposure is calculated from uncorrected ion gauge measurements in Langmuir, involving exposure pressures in the range of 5 × 10-8 to 5 × 10-6 mbar. The adsorbate coverage is determined from XP models as outlined in Ref. [32–35]. In order to validate the CVD-based catalytic results and to obtain a broader experimental basis of the Pd-Zr0 system with respect to methanol steam reforming performance, also an intermetallic bulk phase of Pd and Zr0 was prepared. Synthesis was carried out under HV conditions (base pressure 1 × 10-7 mbar) by heating stacked small pieces of the above-specified pure Pd and Zr foil samples (Alfa Aesar, purity: 99.95%, thickness: 0.127 mm) resistively in a Ta crucible in the nominal atomic ratio 2:1. At a temperature slightly above the melting point of Pd (1828 K), spontaneous reaction between Pd and Zr leads to an intermetallic Pd-Zr melt, which then re-crystallizes toward Pd-Zr bulk phases during re-cooling in vacuum. Subsequently, the sample is transferred to the UHV system with attached batch reactor for analysis and catalytic testing. The nominal 2:1 Pd:Zr stoichiometry (i.e., with Pd excess) is chosen with the idea to maintain at least some active Pd metal surface co-existing with oxidatively segregated Zr species under reaction conditions. Moreover, an excess of Pd is necessary because the melting point of Zr is very high and complete intermetallic formation reaction of Pd with Zr is necessary in order to distribute the Zr0 homogeneously in the melt.
2.1. Catalyst preparation The Pd/Al2O3, Ru/Al2O3 and Pd-Ru/Al2O3 catalysts used in this study were prepared by the wet-impregnation method. First, using Pd (OH)2 (Aldrich Co.) as a precursor, 1 wt% Pd (based on the weight of Al2O3) was dissolved in distilled water. Second, Al2O3 was slowly added to the Pd solution and then stirred for 1 h. The mixed solution was then evaporated using a rotary vacuum evaporator. Thereafter, the solid was dried in an oven at 103 °C for 24 h. Finally, the dried sample was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h and then reduced in 30% H2/N2 at 600 °C for 1 h to prepare the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. To prepare the Pd-Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, 0.9 wt% Pd and 0.1 wt% Ru (based on the weight of Al2O3) were dissolved in distilled water. RuNO (NO3)3 (Alfa Aesar Co.) was used as the Ru precursor and the subsequent process was the same as that used for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst.
2.1 Preparation of the Catalyst An 8.8wt% Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 (Pd relative to Pd/ZnO/Al2O3) catalyst was prepared by multiple incipient wetness impregnations. Specifically, a palladium nitrate solution (4.4 wt% Pd, Aldrich) was mixed with a Zn(NO3)2  6H2O (99.5%, Aldrich). The premixed Pd and Zn nitrate solution (Pd:Zn molar ratio 0.38) was added drop by drop to the alumina support (boehmite from Sasol) calcined at 1,123 K for 5 h prior to the multiple impregnations. A total of five impregnations were used. Between each impregnation step, the powder was dried at 353 K for 2 h. A Pd:Zn ratio of 0.38 was chosen since it is optimum ratio for methanol steam reforming based on our previous report [33].
2.1. Materials and methods Titanium (IV) is opropoxide, 98+% (TIPR) and ammonium hydroxide, reagent ACS were obtained from Acros Organics, New Jersey, USA. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide minimum, 99% (CTAB), Cu (II) nitrate hydrate, 98% ACS reagent, cobalt (II) chloride hexahyd rate, zinc nitrate hexahyd rate 98%, tin chloride dehydrate 98%, and palladium nitrate hydrate were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA. Nickel nitrate, hydroflouric acid, ethanol anhydrous and acetone, ACS reagent were purchased from Fischer Scientific, New Jersey, USA. All materials used were analytical grade and used without further purification. The water used at all stages of the experiments was purified using a Mill-Q Advantage A10 with Elix 5 system obtained from Millipore Corporation (Bedford, MA, USA).
Catalysts used were Ni/ZnO, Co/ZnO and Pt/ZnO. Metal  loading of each sample was kept at i0 wt.%. Ni/ZnO, Co/ZnO and  Pd/ZnO were prepared by impregnation of ZnO (Kanto Chemicals  Ltd.) with solutions of Ni(NO3)2.6H20 (Wako Chemicals Co.  Ltd.), Co(NO3)2"6H20 (Wako Chemicals Co. Ltd.), and Pd(N03) 2  (Tanaka Noble Metals Co. Ltd.) at room temperature,  respectively. In a similar fashion, Pt/ZnO was prepared from  Pt(NH3)4(N03)2 (Aldrich Co. Ltd.) by impregnation of ZnO. For  comparison with the catalysts supported on ZnO, experiments  were conducted over Ni/Si02, Pd/SiO 2, Pt/Si02, ZnO and Zn (Wako  Chemicals Co. Ltd.) respectively. Ni/SiO 2 and Pd/SiO 2 were  obtained similarly to those of Ni/ZnO and Pd/ZnO, respectively.  Pt/Si02 was prepared by impregnation of SiO 2 with a solution of  Pt(NH3) C12 prepared from H2PtCI 6 and an aqueous solution of  ammonia at 353 K. Metal loadings of Ni/SiO 2, Pd/SiO 2 and  Pt/SiO 2 were all maintained at i0 wt.%.  The samples thus prepared were dried at 383 K overnight,  and calcined at 773 K for 3 h in air. The catalysts were then  reduced in a flow of H 2 (PH = 4.0 kPa) or in a mixture of  2  CH30H and H20 (Pert0H = PH o = 24.3 kPa) at 773 K prior to the  3 2  reaction.  
A series of Pd–ZnO or Pd–ZnO–Sc2O3 catalysts doped with CNTs,  denoted as PdiZnj(or PdiZnjSck)–x%(mass percentage)CNTs, were  prepared by a co-precipitation method. An aqueous solution containing calculated amounts of PdCl2 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (or as well  as Sc(NO3)3·6H2O) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring  into a Pyrex flask containing a certain amount of aqueous Na2CO3  solution at 333 K. The addition was adjusted to maintain the pH of  the suspension at 9–10. The suspension was continuously stirred  for 30 min at 333 K, followed by cooling down to room temperature before filtering. The filtered cake was repeatedly washed with  deionized water until the filtrate became neutral in pH. The washed  solid was added into a suspension prepared in advance containing calculated amounts of CNTs, followed by stirring vigorously for  4 h, and then centrifuging-filtering. The obtained solid was dried at  383 K for 12 h and calcined at 633 K for 2 h, yielding the precursor of  PdiZnj–x%CNTs or PdiZnjSck–x%CNTs catalysts (in oxidation state).
Catalyst preparation Catalyst samples of 15.9% Pd/ZnO (in mass fraction) were  prepared from mixtures of PdCl2 and Zn(NO3)3·6H2O solutions by coprecipitation with a Na2CO3 solution (0.6–0.7  mol/L) at 328 K under vigorous stirring. The pH was kept constant at 9–10. The resulting precipitates were aged at 328  K for 2 h, then centrifuged, and thoroughly washed with deionized water. The precipitates were dried overnight in an air  oven at 383 K and then calcined in a muffle oven at 633 K for  2 h. Each calcined catalyst sample was pelletized, crushed,  and sieved to a particle size range of 40–60 mesh for use in  the SRM reaction.
Experimental  A PdO/ZnO catalyst precursor was prepared by the impregnation  of ZnO with Pd(NO3)2 (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo). A 0.03-M aqueous  solution of Pd(NO3)2 with ZnO powder was evaporated at 70 ◦C,  then dried at 120 ◦C for 15 h and finally calcined in air at 500 ◦C for  6 h. The catalyst (3PdZn-imp) contained 3 wt.% of Pd in the reduced  form. The ZnO powder was prepared by precipitation from a 0.5-  M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Wako Chemical, S grade) aqueous solution by  the addition of a 0.5-M Na2CO3 solution at 80 ◦C. After washing,  drying, and calcination in air at 500 ◦C for 6 h, the BET surface area  was 28 m2 g-1.  A PdO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst precursor was prepared by coprecipitation from a 0.2-M aqueous mixture of Pd(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2,  and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Wako, 98 + %) with the addition of an aqueous  solution of 0.5-M Na2CO3 under vigorous stirring at 80 ◦C. After filtration and washing with distilled water, the precipitate was dried  at 120 ◦C for 15 h and finally calcined in air at 500 ◦C for 12 h. Two  catalyst precursors containing 3 and 10 wt.% of Pd in the reduced  form were prepared (3PdZnAl and 10PdZnAl, respectively). The  Al2O3 contents were both 10 wt.%. A coprecipitated PdO/ZnO containing 10 wt.% of Pd in the reduced form (10PdZn) was prepared  by the method described above except for no Al(NO3)3·9H2O in the  starting solution.  A precursor of a composite catalyst was prepared by the  coprecipitation of PdO/ZnO/Al2O3 on an amorphous ZrO2 support  supplied from Catalysis Society of Japan (JRC–ZRO–6; BET surface  area, 279 m2 g-1) [19]. The ZrO2 powder was suspended in the  starting solution of 10PdZnAl by vigorous stirring at 80 ◦C and the  Na2CO3 solution was added. After filtration and washing with distilled water, the composite was also dried at 120 ◦C for 15 h and  calcined in air at 500 ◦C for 12 h. The resulting catalyst, containing  30 wt.% of the coprecipitate, was labeled 3PdZnAl/ZrO2 (Pd content,  3 wt.%).
Catalyst preparation  From a mixture of PdCl2 and Zn(NO3)3·6H2O solutions,  15.9% Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation  with a Na2CO3 solution at 328 K under vigorous stirring according to Ref. [8]. Each calcined catalyst was pelletized,  crushed, and sieved into a particle size of 40–60 mesh, and  then used as catalysts for the SRM reaction.
Catalyst Preparation  The perovskite-type oxide LaCoO3±d was synthesized with  and without Co partial substitution by Pd and/or Zn  (LaCo1-x-yPdxZnyO3±d) by the amorphous citrate method.  Metal precursors [La(NO3)36H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99,9 %), Co(NO3)36H2O (Alfa Aesar), Zn(NO3)36H2O (Alfa Aesar,  99.9 %) and Pd(NO3)3 solution (Alfa Aesar 4.42 % w/w Pd  cont.)] and citric acid monohydrate (Alfa Aesar, 99 %) were  utilized. The detailed synthesis procedure was described  elsewhere [14]. Briefly, desired amounts of metal precursors  were dissolved in deionized water and subsequently citric  acid was added in a metal to acid molar ratio of 1:1. The  solution was evaporated in a rotary evaporator at 70 C to  obtain a viscous solution, which was then dried overnight at  80 C in a vacuum oven and was subjected to calcination in  air at 800 C for 2 h. For the sake of clarity, the catalyst  compositions are abbreviated as shown in Table 1.
Catalyst synthesis  MCM-41 supported mono-metallic (M-MCM-41; M: Cu, Co,  Ni, Pd, Sn, and Zn) catalysts were synthesized using a one-pot  hydrothermal procedure [21]. The molar composition ratios of  the reagents used were: 1TMOS: 0.13CTAB: 130·6H2O: 20Ethanol.  The quantity of metal precursors used was based on the expected  10 wt% metal loading in the final mesoporous matrix. Since all the  synthesized catalysts have 10 wt% metal loading, it is not included  in the designation of the catalysts in rest of the writeup. In a typical synthesis, the surfactant (CTAB) was weighed, dissolved in  de-ionized water at 30 ◦C and stirred to get a colorless solution  A. Another solution designated B was prepared by dissolving the  metal precursors in ethanol. Solution B was gently poured into  solution A and stirred for 30 min. To this mixture, the limiting  reagent (TMOS) was added drop-wise and stirred continuously for another 30 min. Ammonium hydroxide was then added drop-wise  to precipitate the metal hydroxides at pH 10. The solution was then  stirred for another 3 h and then aged in an oven at 65 ◦C for 18 h.  The obtained precipitate was washed with de-ionized water and  ethanol to get a filtrate of pH 7. The filtered material was air dried for  ∼24 h, followed by oven drying at 110 ◦C for 24 h. The catalyst was  calcined at 550 ◦C for 16 h at a heating and cooling rate of 2 ◦C/min  to remove the surfactant (CTAB).
 Preparation of Supported Monometallic and Bimetallic Catalysts  Nickel supported catalysts were prepared by a conventional wet aqueous impregnation method.  NiO phase was introduced on the support (CeO2–Al2O3, CeO2, Al2O3) surface by a wet impregnation  method from the nickel nitrate (V) aqueous solutions. Then the obtained systems were dried for 2 h at  120 ◦C in an air atmosphere and finally calcined for 4 h in air atmosphere at 400 ◦C. Palladium phase  was introduced on the Ni/support catalysts surface by a consequent impregnation method using  Pd(NO3)2 solution. Then the bimetallic systems were dried for 2 h in air atmosphere at 120 ◦C, and then  calcined at 400 ◦C for 4 h at the same atmosphere. Nickel and palladium contents in the catalytic  material were 5, 20, 40, and 60 wt% of Ni and 2 wt% of Pd, respectively.
Preparation and characterization of Pd–Zn/SBA-15  catalysts  Using conventional pore filling impregnation method, various  amounts of Pd and Zn in the ratio of 1:1.5 were loaded over  calcined SBA-15 support. Tetraammine palladium chloride  (Aldrich) and zinc nitrate (BDH) were used as source for Pd and  Zn, respectively. The Pd content was varied from 0.5 to  5.5 wt% and Zn was varied from 0.75 to 8.25 wt%. The  prepared catalysts were dried at 120 C and calcined at 400 C  for 4 h. The Pd–Zn/SBA-15 catalysts were reduced at 400 C  under the hydrogen flow of 40 ml/g/min. The textural characteristics of reduced Pd–Zn/SBA-15 catalysts were analyzed  by N2 physisorption on a Micromeritics 2000 ASAP analyser  following the procedure described earlier for SBA-15 support.  In order to study the effect of reduction temperature on the  reducibility of Pd and Zn, the catalyst (3 wt% Pd–4.5 wt% Zn/  SBA-15) was reduced at 200, 300, 400 and 500 C for 4 h under  the H2 flow of 40 ml/g/min. XRD patterns of the Pd–Zn/SBA-15  catalysts with varying Pd and Zn content as well as reduced at  different temperatures were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray  diffractometer with a nickel filtrated Cu Ka radiation, 2q  angles from 10 to 80 at a scanning speed of 0.05/s. The  H2-TPR of Pd–Zn catalysts was performed at atmospheric  pressure using CHEMBET 3000 TPR analyzer, at a linearly  programmed heating rate of 5 C/min up to 600 C, with 3% H2  in He stream at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The amount of  consumed H2 was monitored by a TCD.
Preparation of plated palladium catalysts  When a palladium component is plated on the surface of an  aluminum substrate, for achieving a strong adhesion of  palladium, it is necessary to carry out an intermediate plating  of a component with an electrode potential between aluminum  and palladium. Because zinc (standard electrode potential:  0.76 V) has an electrode potential between aluminum(1.7 V)  and palladium (+0.82 V), the combination of zinc plating and  palladium plating is a convenient method to provide both strong  adhesion and support for the palladium catalyst. Thus, an  electroless plating, which consisted of a displacement plating of  zinc and a chemical plating of palladium, was used for preparing  a plate-type palladium-based catalyst on an aluminum plate. The  aluminum plate (JIS A1100P-H24, thickness: 0.4 mm) was  formed into a pentagonal prism shape, the sectional view of  which resembled a star. Its maximum diameter was 21 mm and  its length was 120 mm. The apparent total surface area of  electrolessly plated catalyst composition was 330 cm2. The  procedure of preparing a catalyst by electroless plating is shown  in Fig. 1. In order to remove impurities and activate the surface,  the aluminum plate was firstly immersed in 3N hydrogen  chloride solution for about 15 min. The plate was then immersed  in a zinc oxide plating bath (ZnO:50 g/l, NaOH:90 g/l, alkaline,  bath temperature: 20 8C, time: 3 min) to displace the surface  aluminum with zinc, and the plate was washed in a water bath.  The displacement and washing procedures were repeated two  times, although the immersion time of the second displacement  was only 1.5 min. Subsequently, the plate was immersed in a  palladium plating bath (PdCl2: 1.8 g/l, NH2CH2CH2NH2:  5.4 ml/l, S(CH2COOH)2: 0.05 g/l, reducing agent, alkaline,  bath temperature: 30 8C, time: 60 min) to deposit palladium  component on the surface by chemical reduction. Three kinds of reducing agents were used in the palladium plating bath: (I) a  trimethylamine-borane ((CH3)3NBH3, 4.4 g/l), (II) a disodium  hydrogenphosphite pentahydrate (Na2HPO35H2O, 4.3 g/l),  and (III) a sodium phosphinate monohydrate (NaPH2O2H2O,  6.4 g/l). In order to complex a palladium component, the  palladium plating bath was used after agitation for one day and  one night. The lower bath temperature of palladium plating was  adopted, which was 30 8C, so as to avoid exfoliation of the plated  component. After being washed in a water bath, the plated  catalyst was dried in an air at room temperature overnight to  prepare a plate-type palladium-based catalyst.
Catalyst Preparation  In order to suppress a potential influence of the preparation  routine on the catalytic properties, the synthesis protocols  were kept as similar as possible for all catalysts. This particularly refers to the way Pd is introduced, as well as to  the solvents and precipitation agents used.  For the co-precipitated Pd/Ga2O3 catalyst, 100 mg Pd  (Goodfellow Pd foil 99.99%) were dissolved in a mixture  of 5 mL HNO3 (65%) and 1 mL HCl (37%) while gently heating. Subsequently, the volume was increased with  distilled H2O to 50 mL. Separately, 1.5 g Ga (Goodfellow Ga metal 99.9999%) were dissolved in HCl (37%) at  373 K. Both solutions were unified and diluted to 100 mL  total volume using distilled H2O. Afterwards, NaOH (5%)  was added dropwise at 353 K until a pH value of 7–8  was reached. The resulting precipitate was allowed to age  overnight and subsequently filtrated and dried at 373 K.  Remaining Cl was removed by thorough washing. To  obtain the pre-catalyst, the powder was calcined in air at  773 K for 4 h (which also removes the remnants of HNO3  decomposition). Similarly, the respective co-precipitated Pd/In2O3 and  Pd–Ga2O3–In2O3 catalysts were synthesized. For the former, In metal foil (Goodfellow 99.999%) was dissolved  in HNO3 and In(OH)3 precipitated by addition of NaOH (5%). 2.4 g In(OH)3 were then dissolved in 5 mL HCl  (37%) and diluted using distilled H2O up to 20 mL total  volume. The Pd-containing solution (preparation exactly as above) was then added and the unified solution treated  as the Pd–Ga2O3 catalyst above.
The synthesis procedure is a slight modification of that  reported by Cˇ ejka et al. [36] and is based on the addition of  aluminum tri-sec-butoxide to a calculate amount of stearic acid,  previously dissolved in 1-propanol, by sonication, in order to  reach the molar composition of: 1Al(sec-BuO)3:0.33 C17H35  COOH:24C3H7OH:3H2O. The resulting suspension was aged  for 42 h at 100 ℃ in a Teflon-lined autoclave at autogenous  pressure.  The material was calcined in nitrogen flow at 410 ℃ for 6 h  (3 ℃/min) and subsequently in air at 500 ℃ for a further 3 h  (3℃/min). The obtained material is referred to as AA.  The oxide was impregnated with Pd acetate and successively prereduced using a zinc borohydride solution, following a procedure described by Lenarda et al.
Catalyst preparation  A series of single-phase perovskite-type oxides with the general formula LaCo1-x-yPdxZnyO3±δ were synthesized by the  amorphous citrate method.17,19 Metal salt precursors  LaĲNO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), CoĲNO3)3·6H2O (Alfa  Aesar, 98%), ZnĲNO3)3·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) and  PdĲNO3)3 (Alfa Aesar, 4.42% w/w Pd cont.) were used. As a  chelating agent, citric acid monohydrate (Alfa Aesar, 99%)  was utilized. Required amounts of metal precursors were dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water and subsequently,  citric acid was added in a metal-to-acid molar ratio of 1 : 1.1.  The resulting aqueous solution was carefully evaporated in a  rotary evaporator at 70 °C and 100 mbar to obtain a viscous  solution, which was then dried overnight at 80 °C in a vacuum oven operated between 50 and 70 mbar. The resulting  solid foam-like material was ground in a mortar and  subjected to calcination in synthetic air at 800 °C for 2 h.  With this method, perovskite-type oxide catalysts with varying  Pd and Zn molar ratios (0.09, 0.38, 1.0 and 1.15) were prepared. Also, LaCo1-x-yPdxZnyO3±δ catalysts having different  degrees (x and y = 0.05, 0.15 and 0.25) of Co substitution  with Pd and Zn (at a 1 : 1 Pd : Zn molar ratio) were synthesized. For comparative purposes, reference perovskite-type  oxides of unsubstituted LaCoO3±δ (LCO), palladiumsubstituted LaCo0.873Pd0.127O3±δ (LCPO) and zinc-substituted  LaCo0.89Zn0.11O3±δ (LCZO) were also prepared. For the sake of  clarity, the catalyst compositions are abbreviated. For example, LCPZO-1.15 indicates the presence of La, Co, Pd and Zn,  while the number defines the Pd : Zn molar ratio in the catalyst. Similarly, the second number in a catalyst like LCPZO-1-  0.15 indicates a Pd and Zn (at a 1 : 1 ratio) substitution level  of 15 mol% in LaCo0.85Pd0.075Zn0.075O3±δ. The catalyst composition, Pd and/or Zn content and BET surface area are  reported in Table 1.
Materials and Methods for Catalyst Preparations All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Canada (Oakville, ON, Canada)  and all the gases were purchased from Praxair Canada Inc. (Mississauga, ON, Canada). The  preparation method of the CZA catalyst via oxalate gel-coprecipitation has been previous  reported by our group [34], the optimum molar ratio of Cu:Zn:Al (35:35:30) has also been  determined previously and is used throughout this work [35]. The Pd was loaded onto  a calcined Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 and commercial ZnO catalyst support via an impregnation  method. All the catalyst supports were dried at 110 ◦C for more than 12 h (overnight)  to remove the moisture before Pd impregnation. A designated amount of palladium (II)  acetate (≥98%) was placed into a round bottom flask and dissolved with the pre-calculated  amount of acetone (ACS reagent grade) needed to meet 35 mL solvent per gram of catalyst  support. Then the catalyst support was weighed and placed into the palladium acetate  solution and aged for 6 h. The flask was then placed in a water batch at 70 ◦C under  vigorous stirring until the solvent was completely evaporated. The catalyst was then dried  in an oven at 110 ◦C overnight. The dried particles were ground and screened via a sieve  with 250 µm opening and then calcined in stationary air at 360 ◦C for 4 h. The percentages  of the Pd loading through this work are all on weight fraction basis.
The synthetic procedure was similar to that described in Section 2.2.  The only difference, was that Pd stearate (0.011 mol), prepared in advance, was added to water and zinc stearate. The Pd/ZnO ratio was 1:20 wt%. After calcination at 410 ◦C for 6 h and at 500 ◦C for 3 h, the sample was finally reduced in pure H2 up to 500 ◦C (heating rate 3 ◦C/min and 35 cm3/min) and kept at this temperature  for 20 h.  The Pd content determined by AAS was 1.6 wt% and the zinc was 12.6 wt%.  The resulting material was denominated EMP2Z20.
ZnO nanowire were fabricated by a thermal evaporation-condensation method in a high temperature  tube furnace [3]. The deposition of Pd was accomplished by dipping the ZnO nanowires into an  aqueous solution containing Pd(NO3)2 as precursor salts. The pH value of the aqueous solution was  maintained, by adding Na2CO3, between 8 and 9. Then filtered, washed and dried at room  temperature under vacuum overnight. The nominal Pd loading was 10 wt%. The catalysts was  reduced by hydrogen at the temperature of 250 oC for 2 hours, prior to reactivity measurement in  methanol steam reforming.
Preparation of the catalytic material Monometallic copper and nickel catalysts supported on  (ZrO2)x(Al2O3)y binary oxide supports were prepared by a  wet aqueous impregnation method. Binary oxide ZrOAl2O3 (Zr:Al = 2:1, 1:1, 1:2) systems were prepared by a coprecipitation method. In order to prepare a working range of binary oxides, the following molar ratios of Zr:Al = 2:1, 1:1,  1:2 were used. Aqueous solutions of 1 mol/L zirconium (IV) nitrate and 1 mol/L aluminium nitrate were mixed in appreciate quantities under vigorous stirring at 80 C. A concentrated ammonia solution was then added dropwise until the pH reached values of between 10 and 11, respectively. Then the mixtures were stirred for another 30 min. The resulting fine precipitates were washed two times in deionised water and then dried at 120 C for 15 h and calcined for 4 h at 400 C in air atmosphere. The metal phase (i.e., Cu or Ni) was introduced on the supports using aqueous solutions of copper nitrate (V) or nickel nitrate (V). Copper or nickel loading on the catalyst surface was 20 wt%. The supported catalysts were then dried for 2 h at 120 C and calcined for 4 h in an air atmosphere at 400 C. Bimetallic supported catalysts 1% Pd(Rh)–  20% Cu/ZrO2Al2O3 and 1% Pd(Rh)–20% Ni/ZrO2Al2O3 (Zr:Al = 1:2) were prepared by an impregnation method on  the surface of the previously prepared supported copper or  nickel catalysts systems.
 Preparation of monometallic Ni and bimetallic Pd-Ni catalysts  Monometallic nickel catalysts supported on both mono and binary oxide were  prepared by wet aqueous impregnation method using aqueous solutions of nickel  nitrate (V). The prepared monometallic catalysts were dried for 2h at 120 C in air  atmosphere and calcined for 4 h at 400 °C at the same atmosphere. Palladium promoter  was added on the previously obtained monometallic supported nickel system surface  by consequent impregnation method using Pd(NO3)2 as a precursor. In the next step of  the preparation procedure bimetallic catalysts were dried for 2h in air atmosphere at  120 °C, and afterwards were calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in air atmosphere. The content  of nickel in the catalytic systems was 5, 20, 40 and 60 wt. %, respectively. While, the  palladium loading in all cases was 2 wt. %.
Synthesis of the supports and catalysts  Two types of zinc oxide supports were prepared in waterin-oil microemulsions, composed of cyclohexane (nonpolar phase), 0.5 M aqueous solutions of zinc nitrate or ammonium carbonate as precipitating agent (polar phase),  n-butanol (co-surfactant) and cationic hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or anionic dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium (Bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate sodium  salt, AOT) surfactant, respectively. The water-to-surfactant  molar ratio was 50, and the mass ratio of co-surfactant to  surfactant was 1:1. The microemulsions containing zinc  nitrate and ammonium carbonate were mixed and stabilized for 3 h at room temperature. Next, microemulsion  was destabilized with tetrahydrofuran (THF) with volume  three times greater than the volume of mixture. The  obtained materials were centrifuged, transferred to filtration and washed with chloroform, water and ethanol. After  24 h, the samples were dried at 110 C overnight and  calcined at 400 C for 6 h. The supports were denoted as  ZnO-CTAB and ZnO-AOT, respectively. The obtained  supports were impregnated with acetone solution of palladium acetylacetonate. After impregnation and mixing of  the dispersed system for 2 h, the temperature was  increased to 55 C to complete acetone evaporation. The  product was dried at 110 C overnight and next calcined at  250 C for 2 h.
Materials and Methods  A series of Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness technique by  impregnating ZnO powder (Aldrich, 99%) with palladium II acetate salt (Aldrich, 99.9%)  dissolved in acetone6. Al2O3 supported Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared using a one-step coimpregnation method7. Activity tests were carried out in a 4 mm I.D. quartz tube reactor. The  product gases, CO, CO2, and H2, were analyzed on-line by means of a MTI Quad Micro GC  (Model Q30L) equipped with a TCD. Transmission electron microscopy imaging was conducted on a JEOL 2010 high-resolution analytical electron microscope operating at 200 kV with a LaB6 filament.
Experimental  The experimental setup combines UHV (ultrahigh vacuum) facilities for the preparation  and characterization of model catalysts by XPS and LEED (Low Energy Electron  Diffraction) with the possibility of in situ surface spectroscopy by PM-IRAS. PM-IRAS is well suited for in situ investigations of gas-surface interactions, since it allows to detect surface adsorbed molecules/species even under atmospheric pressure [2]. PdZn 1:1 surface alloys were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Zn onto a Pd(111) single crystal substrate at 77 K and subsequent annealing at 550 K. A well ordered LEED pattern was obtained, in agreement with recent STM and DFT studies suggesting a coexistence of 3 rotational domains of a (2x1) structure [3,4,5]. XPS detected alloy related features at a binding energy of 335.6 eV (Pd 3d5/2) and 1021.0 eV (Zn 2p3/2).
Materials and Methods PdZn type catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation. Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared by impregnating ZnO support with palladium II acetate salt dissolved in acetone [2]. Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized co-impregnating Pd nitrate and Zn nitrate solutions on alumina support [3]. The catalysts were characterized using BET measurements, H2 chemisorptions, XRD, and FTIR spectroscopy. Catalytic activity was studied for methanol steam reforming (MSR), the water-gas shift (WGS) and reverse-water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions.
Materials and Methods A series of single phase Pd2+ and Zn2+-substituted perovskite catalysts with the general formula of LaCo1-xB'xO3-1/2x (B' = Pd2+ and Zn2+) were prepared by the amorphous citrate method. The as prepared precursors were dried overnight in vacuum at 80 ˚C and calcined in air at 800 ˚C (5 ˚C/min) for 2h (Table 1). The catalysts were thoroughly characterized by various techniques such as N2-physisorption, XRD, H2-TPR, XPS. The SRM activity of the catalysts was determined in a flow reactor. Various reaction parameters such as feed composition, pretreatment temperature/environment and durability were evaluated.
Materials and Methods Two Pd/ZnO catalysts (denoted ZnO-A and ZnO-B) were prepared using an incipient wetness method on two types of ZnO supports with distinguished morphologies, i.e., nano rods and nano plates respectively. Pd acetate solution was prepared by dissolving Pd II acetate in acetone. The Pd loadings are 3.5 and 5 wt % for Pd/ZnO-A and Pd/ZnO-B catalysts, respectively. The texture and structure of the catalysts were investigated by BET measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR spectroscopy and Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). The catalytic activity was tested for the steam reforming of methanol.
Pd-Zn catalysts were prepared by the heat trcatment of the physical mixturcsof Pd and Zn powders at various temperatures in a nitrogen stream at a flow rateof 50 cn3/min. The Pd/Zn molar ratio was varied from 1/1 to 1/8. Forcomparison,experiments werc also conducted over a Ni-Zn or a Fe-Zncatalysts，respectively, prepared from Ni and Zn or Fe and Zn in a similar manner to the preparation of Pd-Zn catalysts. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were treated in a hydrogen stream (4 vol.%H2) diluted with nitrogen under tempcrature-progranmed conditions at a heating rate of 5 K/min up to temperatures where the catalysts were previously treated in nitrogen.
Materials and Methods A series of Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness technique by impregnating ZnO powder (Aldrich, 99%) with palladium II acetate salt (Aldrich, 99.9%) dissolved in acetone6. Al2O3 supported Pd/ZnO catalysts were prepared using a one-step coimpregnation method7. Activity tests were carried out in a 4 mm I.D. quartz tube reactor. The product gases, CO, CO2, and H2, were analyzed on-line by means of a MTI Quad Micro GC (Model Q30L) equipped with a TCD. Transmission electron microscopy imaging was conducted on a JEOL 2010 high-resolution analytical electron microscope operating at 200 kV with a LaB6 filament.
Synthesis conditions Ternary palladium containing and binary Pd-free PdMgAl, PdMgGa, PdZnAl, MgGa, ZnAl, and MgAl HTlc with M2+/M3+ molar ratios of 70:30 were synthesized by co-precipitation. The nominal composition of all Pd-M2+–M3+ samples was set to 1:69:30. A mixed aqueous metal nitrate ([Pd2+] + [M2+] + [M3+] = 0.2 M) solution and 0.345 M basic precipitating agent solution were co-fed at pH = 8.5. For MgGa and MgAl, HTlc precursors pure sodium carbonate solution and a precipitation temperature of 328 K were used, whereas in case of PdZnAl HTlc a mixture of sodium carbonate (0.3 M) and sodium hydroxide (0.045 M) and a temperature of 298 K has be applied in order to obtain an homogeneous precursor sample. During precipitation, both solutions were added simultaneously dropwise into a 2-L precipitation reactor (Mettler-Toledo LabMax). The nitrate solution was automatically pumped with a constant dosing rate, and the basic solution was added to maintain a constant pH of 8.5. After completion of addition, the mixture was aged for 1 h at the same temperatures applied during synthesis. The precipitate was filtered and washed twice with warm deionized water in order to remove the nitrate and sodium ions and obtain a conductivity of the filtrate lower than 0.2 mS/cm. The solid was dried for 12 h at 353 K in air. After drying, a one-step decomposition–reduction in 5 vol% H2/Ar (2 K/min) was performed at the temperatures extracted from H2-TPR experiments that yielded in the intermetallic phases and in metallic Pd in case of the PdMgAl HTlc precursor. A reduction temperature of 523 K was applied for the PdMgAl and PdZnAl system, whereas a reduction of 773 K is needed to obtain Pd2Ga intermetallic particles.
Catalyst preparation 10 wt% Pd/In2O3 was prepared by wet impregnation using Pd (NO3)22 H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 40% Pd) on In2O3 (Chempur, >99.99%) according to procedures described in the literature [23]. For a typical impregnation 3.5 g In2O3 was suspended in a solution of 1.042 g Pd(NO3)22 H2O in 20 mL deionized water with 2–3 drops of concentrated nitric acid (Sigma–Aldrich, >65%). Subsequently, 200 mL of deionized water was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min prior to the removal of the water in vacuum at 70 C. The impregnated sample was calcined at 400 C for three hours in synthetic air (Air Liquide, 20.5% O2 in N2). A 10 wt% Pd/ SiO2 sample (SiO2: Wacker, HDK-N20) was prepared using the same procedure.
For the preparation 5 mL of the ZnO sol were mixed with 2.5 mL of a Pd nanoparticle suspension. The Pd nanoparticle suspension was prepared by diluting 3 mL of a 5*10-3 M solution of H[PdCl4] to a total volume of 5 mL followed by an injection of 0.5 mL of a freshly prepared 50*10-3 M NaBH4 solution under vigorous stirring. Transformation of Pd/ZnO Aerogels to ZnPd/ZnO Aerogels: All three aerogel morphologies were heated under oxidative conditions (synthetic air) to remove organic residues from the synthesis. Afterward, the materials were treated under reducing conditions in hydrogen atmosphere under elevated temperatures to initiate the formation of the intermetallic compound ZnPd.
Catalyst performance PdZn/Ceria catalyst is highly active for methanol conversion. Upon contact with the methanol/water mixture (63 wt% methanol), methanol was converted almost completely at 300 ◦C at a GHSV of 33,000 h-1(Fig. 1). The reforming selectivity was found to improve with time-on-stream and the catalyst shows high activity over a range of operating temperatures and space velocities. No detectable methane was found. An increase in the operating temperature to 400 ◦C resulted in more CO production. CO selectivity and methanol conversion were observed to decrease progressively with increase in space velocity at 400 ◦C (Fig. 1). As will be further discussed this initial decrease in methanol conversion and progressive improvement in reforming selectivity is closely related to chemical and structural transformation of the catalyst. After nearly 600 h continuous operation, reforming selectivity (CO2) increased from 70% to about 90% and methanol conversion dropped by about 25% (Fig. 2). An attempt to regenerate catalyst using air oxidation at 600 ◦C was carried out in a separate test after about 190 h on stream operation (Fig. 3). Methanol conversion was found to increase from about 60% to 100% but the reforming selectivity to H2 and CO2 decreased from about 83% to 60% and CO selectivity increased from 18% to 40% (Fig. 3). These results indicate possible changes in the catalyst surface properties after regeneration.
Materials PdZn aerosol-derived catalysts were made using Palladium and Zinc Nitrate (Aldrich, 99.99%+) dissolved in 10% nitric acid to make a 45 mM solution. The nitrate salt mixture was atomized using a commercial nebulizer device (Walgreens Cool Mist Humidifier) to produce droplets that dried as they passed through a furnace operating at 700 C using 1.5LPM N2 carrier gas with a residence time of approximately 0.1 s, and were collected on a 0.4 lm filter. The collected powder was reduced at 500 C in flowing 5%/95% H2/N2 for 4 h. The reduction temperature was selected based on previous studies for making the PdZn L10 phase that allow rapid formation of the intermetallic but without significant loss of Zn due to evaporation. This approach is described in detail in a previous study where phase pure PdZnb1 was synthesized [2]. The reference Pd powder (Alfa, 99.98%) was calcined in air at 350 C for 3 h, and then reduced at 500 C in flowing 5% H2 for 4 h.
Catalyst preparation 10 wt% Pd/In2O3 was prepared by wet impregnation using Pd (NO3)22 H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 40% Pd) on In2O3 (Chempur, >99.99%) according to procedures described in the literature [23]. For a typical impregnation 3.5 g In2O3 was suspended in a solution of 1.042 g Pd(NO3)22 H2O in 20 mL deionized water with 2–3 drops of concentrated nitric acid (Sigma–Aldrich, >65%). Subsequently, 200 mL of deionized water was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min prior to the removal of the water in vacuum at 70 C. The impregnated sample was calcined at 400 C for three hours in synthetic air (Air Liquide, 20.5% O2 in N2). A 10 wt% Pd/ SiO2 sample (SiO2: Wacker, HDK-N20) was prepared using the same procedure. For comparison a conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst with a molar composition of the metal oxides of 67.5/22.5/10 was prepared by co-precipitation from the respective nitrates according to the literature [37]. 20.667 g Cu(NO3)23 H2O (Merck, 99.5%), 23.522 g Zn(NO3)24 H2O (Merck, 98.5%) and 26.079 g Al(NO3)39 H2O (Grüssing, 98%) were dissolved in 500 mL of a 1:1 ethanol–water mixture (v/v) (ethanol: Roth, 99.8%) and quickly added to a solution of 52.99 g Na2CO3 (Grüssing, 99.5%) in 500 mL 1:1 ethanol–water mixture (v/v). The resulting gel was aged for 1.5 h at 40 C. Subsequently the precipitate was filtered and washed several times with deionized water. The product was dried at 90 C for five hours prior to calcination in synthetic air with a heatingrate of 3 C/min and holding for 12 h at 400 C.
Catalyst preparation and pretreatment We prepared three Pd/ZnO catalysts, two by incipient wetness and one by batch co-precipitation. For the catalyst prepared by co-precipitation, ZnO powder (Aldrich) was first dissolved in a solution of 5 wt% Pd in 15.7 M nitric acid. The pH was then slowly adjusted to 9.5 using 5 N NaOH solution. The precipitate was filtered, washed and dried at room temperature under vacuum overnight. The nominal Pd loading was 15 wt%. The catalyst prepared by co-precipitation will be called Pd/ZnO-A. For the catalyst prepared by incipient wetness, a solution of Pd acetate in acetone was prepared (2.5 wt% Pd). The solution was added to the ZnO powder (Aldrich) (about 0.5 ml g1) and the mixture was shaken to ensure even distribution. The powder was dried at 80 1C and the process was repeated a total of 8 times until 8.5 wt% Pd was achieved. This catalyst will be called Pd/ZnO-B. The third catalyst was prepared by adding a solution of 11.2 wt% Pd in 15.7 M nitric acid to the ZnO powder while mixing with a glass rod (the acidic solution etched the surface of ZnO powder and made it difficult to mix using a stirring bar), then the powder was dried at 80 1C. The Pd weight loading was 9.0 wt%. This catalyst will be called Pd/ZnO-C. All catalysts were calcined at 350 1C for 5 hours. Aliquots of the calcined catalysts were exposed to hydrogen reduction (3% H2 in He at 30 sccm total flow rate) at temperatures between 250 and 400 1C for 2 hours, prior to reactivity measurement in methanol steam reforming for 4 hours. After reduction, the catalyst was brought to the reaction temperature of 250 1C under He flow, then the methanol–water mixture was introduced to measure the catalyst reactivity. In the following sections, all catalysts will be labeled by their pretreatment. All the characterization was done after the catalyst was exposed to the reaction conditions for 4 hours and then transferred under ambient conditions.
Materials The following materials were used as supports. Multiwall carbon nanotube (labelled as CNT) and activated carbon (labelled as Norit). The surface area of CNT is 170 m2/g, and that of carbon Norit 1175 m2/g. The preparation of carbon nanotube has been described elsewhere [25]. Carbon Norit was purchased from ALFA AESAR. Both carbon supports have been purified by treatment with HCl (10%) for 12 h at room temperature. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness method impregnating the carbon supports with solutions of metal compounds to yield a nominal 2 wt% metal. The following salts of Pt metals were used: H2PtCl5.6H2O, PdCl2, RhCl3.3H2O, H2IrCl6 and RuCl3.3H2O. The impregnated powders were dried at 383 K. The fragments of catalyst pellets were oxidized at 673 K for 30 min and reduced at 673 K for 60 min. XPS measurement revealed the complete reduction of all samples at this temperature. The dispersity of the supported metals was determined by hydrogen adsorption. We obtained the following values: 26.1% for Ir, 24.3% for Rh: 23.5% for Pt: 8.6% for Pd and 5.6% for Ru.
Synthesis of PdZn/ZnO catalysts The 4.7 wt % PdZn/ZnO catalysts were prepared following a standard wet impregnation technique, using hydrothermally prepared ZnO supports (Section 2.1) and ZnO commercial support (Sigma–Aldrich, ZnO nanopowder) for comparison. In a typical procedure, the appropriate amount of ZnO support was wetted by 10 mL of chloroform to prepare a slurry. Subsequently, a solution of a calculated amount of palladium acetate (Sigma–Aldrich, reagent grade 98%) in 5 mL of chloroform was added dropwise to the slurry of the ZnO support under vigorous ultrasonic treatment. The solvent was then dried out at ambient conditions under continuous magnetic stirring while placed in a fume hood. PdZn alloy formation is necessary to obtain good catalytic activities in MSR, thus the catalyst reduction temperature was optimized by monitoring various reduction temperatures using an on-line XRD technique. The optimum temperature of PdZn alloy formation was chosen at 400 ◦C in H2 flow (200 mL/min), with a heating rate of 4.2 ◦C/min and a dwell time of 2 h.
Synthesis and characterization of PdO/gallia materials To obtain Ga-Pd IMC nanoparticles with uniform size supported on a-, b-, and g-Ga2O3, we prepared the precursors by coprecipitation of a mixed solution of Ga and Pd nitrate with sodium carbonate, with homogeneous distribution of Pd and Ga. Syntheses were based on the optimal preparation conditions for the different Ga2O3 modifications in aqueous solution described in our previous study.[20] The only modification to the synthesis presented therein was that for this study Pd2+ was added to the starting solution to give a molar Ga/Pd ratio of 98:2, resulting in a 1 wt% loading based on Pd/Ga2O3. A detailed description of the co-precipitates and their thermal properties are given in the Supporting Information. PdO/aGa2O3 and PdO/b-Ga2O3 were prepared by calcinations of an aGaOOH precursor at different temperatures, whereas PdO/gGa2O3 was obtained from an amorphous precursor. The presence of the different gallia modifications after calcination were confirmed by XRD analysis (Figure 1 a, c, e) The textural properties of the three samples, reported in Table 1, were found to be similar to those reported previously for the pure gallia polymorphs.[20] As a first indication of homogenous Pd distribution, no crystalline PdO could be detected by XRD and the color of the materials was yellow rather than brown as would be expected for bulk-PdO. In agreement with the pure Gallia samples,[20] SEM investigation revealed differences in particle morphology (Figure 1b,d,f). a-Ga2O3 and bGa2O3 were prepared from micrometer-sized a-GaOOH particles and the “rice grain-like” morphology of the precursor aggregates[20] has been conserved upon calcination at 4008C (aphase, Figure 1b) and 8008C (b-phase, Figure 1d). Larger pores are present at the surface of the b-phase after calcination at higher temperature. In contrast, the mostly amorphous gGa2O3, which possesses the highest specific surface area (Table 1), exhibits aggregates of very small nanoparticles (< 10 nm)[20] after calcination at 5008C (Figure 1 f).
Experimental Section For catalytic and electron microscopy studies, a Pd/ZnO (9.2 wt.%) powder catalyst was prepared following a standard incipient-wetness technique, in close analogy to Ref. [5]. Reductive pretreatment to induce the formation of ZnPd was performed at 773 K in H2 (5 vol.%). The catalytic experiments were performed in a CH3OH/H2O (1:1) mixture up to 673 K. Pre- and post-reaction analysis of the catalyst was done by XRD. Aberration-corrected electron microscopy was performed on samples after the respective treatments in the reactor, with only short contact to air for transfer to the electron microscope. For further experimental details, see the Supporting Information.
Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation method using commercial g-Al2O3 as catalyst support (250 m2/g). The Pt, In2O3 and ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via impregnating g-Al2O3 with H2PtCl6, In(NO3)3 and Zn(NO3)2 aqueous solution, kept static at room temperature for 12 h, and then dried at 110 C for 12 h, finally calcined at 500 C for 4 h in air. The Pt-In2O3/Al2O3 and Pt-ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the same procedure except that the as-prepared In2O3 and ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts were impregnated with a certain amount of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution. The obtained catalysts were denoted as xA/yB/Al2O3, where A and B refer to different metals while x and y refer to Pt, ZnO and In2O3 loadings (wt%), respectively.
Catalyst preparation For the preparation of the 3% PdZn/ZnO catalysts used in this study, ZnCl2 (≥98%, Sigma Aldrich) and PdCl2 (≥99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) were used as metal precursors without further purification. Additional HCl was introduced in the form of a 0.58 M solution, prepared by the dropwise addition of 5 mL of concentrated HCl (37.2%, 12.1 M) into 95 mL of an PdCl2 aqueous solution (6 mg Pd per mL) under continuous stirring. The solution was left stirring for 16 h (at 500 rpm) at ambient temperature. For catalyst synthesis, the requisite amounts of aqueous Zn (6 mg mL-1, 3.3 ml) and Pd precursor solutions (6 mg mL-1, 6.65 ml) were charged into a 50 mL round-bottom flask containing deionized water (5 mL); samples with HCl added, were designated as a modified impregnation (MImp) catalysts, whereas those without HCl are termed as conventional impregnation (CImp) catalysts. The content of the flask was stirred vigorously (1000 rpm) and the temperature of the oil bath was raised from room temperature to 60 °C over a period of 10 min. When a temperature of 60 °C was reached, the ZnO support (1.94 g, Aldrich) was added slowly over an 8–10 min period with constant stirring. The pH of the solution was analysed continuously using a Toledo pH meter. When addition of the support material was complete, the slurry was stirred at 60 °C for an additional 15 min and then the temperature of the oil bath was raised to 95 °C, and the slurry was stirred overnight until all the water had evaporated leaving a dry solid. This solid powder was subsequently transferred into a mortar and pestle and was ground thoroughly. For the preparation of acid treated ZnO support materials, 6.65 ml of 0.58 M aqueous HCl was added to a round bottom flask containing 8.3 ml water under vigorous stirring conditions. Next, 1.96 g of ZnO was added to the mixture and stirred at room temperature and the subsequent synthesis steps remained the same as for the standard preparation procedure described above. Finally, the catalyst was pre-treated in the methanol steam reforming (MSR) reactor under a steady flow of 5% H2 in Ar for 4 h at 500 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1.
Catalyst preparation Co-precipitation (CP) and microemulsion (ME) methods were employed for the preparation of Pd/ZnO catalysts. The preparation of CP samples followed the procedure described in our previous paper [23]. The preparation of ME samples followed a procedure similar to that described by Agrell et al. [20]. Briefly, two kinds of microemulsion were prepared by adding aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 or Pd(NO3)2 + Zn(NO3)2 (Pd/Zn molar ratio = 0.2) into a solution of 20% NP-5 (Nonphenolethoxylate) surfactant in cyclohexane. The water/ surfactant molar ratio (v0) was 6.0. The Pd(NO3)2 microemulsion was then reduced with hydrazine, followed by chemical destabilization with THF (tetrahydrofuran) and deposition of the Pd particles onto the ZnO support under vigorous stirring. The catalyst was then recovered by filtration and washing with methanol. In the case of the Pd(NO3)2 + Zn(NO3)2 microemulsion, an aqueous solution containing a suitable amount of hydrazine and Na2CO3 was added for a simultaneous reduction of Pd2+ and precipitation of Zn2+ in the microemulsion. The deposition of this reduced and precipitated microemulsion onto ZnO support and the catalyst recovery procedure were then the same as for the Pd(NO3)2 microemulsion. The samples were denoted as ME and MEM catalysts for the Pd(NO3)2 and the Pd(NO3)2 + Zn(NO3)2 microemulsion processes, respectively. The prepared Pd/ZnO catalysts were identified according to their preparation method and designated loading amount of Pd. For example, the sample prepared by MEM method with 6.5 wt.% Pd was identified as MEM6.5. Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/ZrO2 were prepared by conventional impregnation (IMP) of Al2O3 and ZrO2 with an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2. Two Al2O3-based supports were prepared. One was impZnAl2O4, prepared by impregnation of Al2O3 with a stoichiometric quantity of Zn(NO3)2 to form ZnAl2O4, whilst the other was cp-ZnAl2O4, prepared by the co-precipitation method. Both precursors were dried at 80 ℃ overnight and then calcined at 600 ℃ for 2 h. cp-ZnCr2O4 was prepared by similar procedure to that of cp-ZnAl2O4. This dried precursor was also calcined at 600 ℃ for 2 h. The supported Pd/ZnO catalysts with Pd loading of 2% and 6.5% were then prepared by impregnation of the prepared impZnAl2O4, cp-ZnAl2O4 and cp-ZnCr2O4 with Pd(NO3)2 + Zn(NO3)2 aqueous solution having a Pd/Zn molar ratio of 0.2. All the catalysts were finally calcined at 450 ℃ for 2 h, and crushed to a particle size of 0.15–0.25 mm for the activity test.
Catalyst preparation Because ZnO readily dissolves under acidic conditions, our Pd/ZnO catalyst was prepared by coprecipitation. First, ZnO powder (Aldrich) was dissolved in a 5 wt% Pd in nitric acid. The pH was then slowly adjusted to 9.5 using NaOH. The precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried at room temperature under vacuum overnight. The dried catalyst before calcination is designated “as-prepared” (AP). The nominal Pd loading was 15 wt%. Two additional catalysts were also prepared on an alumina support to clarify some of the observations in this work. The Pd/Al2O3 and PdZn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness technique. The Al2O3 was prepared by calcining boehmite (Sasol) at 850 ◦C for 5 h. For the Pd/Al2O3, a solution of 10 wt% Pd(NO3)2 in nitric acid was added dropwise to the Al2O3, and the mixture was shaken to ensure even distribution; then the powder was dried at 80 ◦C. The process was repeated until 7.4 wt% Pd was achieved. For the PdZn/Al2O3, a solution of Pd and Zn nitrates (Pd/Zn molar ratio = 0.38) was added drop by drop to the Al2O3 and the powder was shaken to ensure even distribution, then the powder was dried at 80 ◦C. The process was repeated until 7.2 wt% Pd was achieved, corresponding to 11.6 wt% PdZn when complete alloy formation was achieved.
Preparation of the core/shell structured NixOye, FexOye, and CoxOyePd catalysts First, NiO, Fe2O3, and Co3O4 were synthesized as the raw core materials using the conventional hydrothermal method [23], and the particle sizes were 25, 10, and 50e70 nm, respectively. Three core/shell structured catalysts, NixOye, FexOye, and CoxOyePd were prepared as shown in the left of Fig. 1. Then 1.0 g of metal oxides (NiO, Fe2O3, and Co3O4) was added to 50 ml of a tetrahydrofuran (THF, Aldrich, 99.99%) solvent in order to suppress the oxidative conditions through the formation of a hydroxyl group. Additionally, 0.03 mol of Pd (NO3)2 (Aldrich, 99.99%) was added into the solution, and then 0.06 mol of ascorbic acids (Aldrich, 99.99%) was added to create a reducing environment. This procedure was repeated several times because the shell was not well formed through a one-step reduction. The slurry was homogeneously stirred and evaporated below 80 C for 3 h. The core/shell structures were calcined at 500 C for 2 h in N2 in order to stabilize the skeleton. The core/shell structured metal oxide (MxOy)/Pd was loaded onto the surface of the commercial Zeolite Y (particle size 10 mm, Aldrich Co.) at a loading of 10 wt% through the incipient wetness impregnation. After being impregnated, the final samples (core/shell MxOy/Pd loaded Zeolite Y) were thermally treated in N2 at 500 C for 2 h. All of the samples were thermally treated in H2/argon (1:10 ratio) at 700 C for 2 h, before the ethanol steam reforming.
Materials Ga2O3-supported Pd catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of commercial b-Ga2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99% purity, particle size <250 lm). The Ga2O3 surface area was determined by the adsorption of N2 according to BET and amounted to 7 m2/g. Metal loadings of 2 and 5 wt.% were prepared by varying the amount of palladium(II) acetate (Fluka) precursor dissolved in toluene (Merck, p.a.). After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 373 K for 48 h and subsequently calcined at 773 K for 4 h in static air. Reduction of the catalysts was performed in situ, except for transmission electron microscopy measurements for which samples were reduced externally. Transmission electron micrographs were acquired with a 200 kV FEI TECNAI F20 S-TWIN analytical transmission electron microscope, equipped with a field emission source. TEM specimens were prepared by dipping a holey carbon–coated copper grid into the fine sample powders. Before microscopy, catalyst samples were reduced (ex situ) in a H2 flow for 120 min. Reduction temperatures were 303 K and 673 K.
Synthesis of ZrO2-supported catalysts Monometallic catalysts containing 4 wt.% of Pd were prepared by wet impregnation of the previously prepared supports. A solution of a calculated amount of palladium acetate (Pd(O2CCH3)2; Sigma–Aldrich) was prepared with chloroform. Then the appropriate amount of support was added to the solution. The impregnated samples were dried at 120 ◦C overnight and calcined at 400 ◦C for 1 h in an oxygen atmosphere (60 mL min-1), cooled in N2 (60 mL min-1) to room temperature, and then reduced in a hydrogen flow (150 mL min-1) for 2 h at 400 ◦C. Bimetallic CuPd-supported catalysts containing 20 wt.% Cu and 4 wt.% Pd were obtained by sequential impregnation. First, palladium was loaded onto the ZrO2 support, dried and heated under O2 at 400 ◦C for 2 h. Then copper was impregnated on the Pd/ZrO2 sample using copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2; Prolabo) as precursor. These catalysts were calcined at 360 ◦C in static air for 8.5 h and then reduced in H2 for 2 h at 400 ◦C. For comparative purposes, a monometallic Cu (20 wt.% Cu) catalyst supported on the previously obtained ZrO2-m carrier was prepared. The same experimental procedure as that used for the impregnation of Cu in the bimetallic CuPd/ZrO2 catalysts was followed. Monometallic and bimetallic catalysts will be denoted in terms of the metal and the ZrO2 supports used: M/ZrO2-x, where M represents the metal: Pd or CuPd and x stands for the ZrO2 phase, -m or -c, respectively. Thus, the catalyst CuPd/ZrO2-m was prepared from a ZrO2-m support impregnated with Cu and Pd.
Materials and methods Titanium (IV) isopropoxide, 98+% (TIPR) and ammonium hydroxide, reagent ACS were obtained from Acros Organics, New Jersey, USA. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide minimum, 99% (CTAB), Cu (II) nitrate hydrate, 98% ACS reagent, cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate, zinc nitrate hexahydrate 98%, tin chloride dehydrate 98%, and palladium nitrate hydrate were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA. Nickel nitrate, hydroflouric acid, ethanol anhydrous and acetone, ACS reagent were purchased from Fischer Scientific, New Jersey, USA. All materials used were analytical grade and used without further purification. The water used at all stages of the experiments was purified using a Mill-Q Advantage A10 with Elix 5 system obtained from Millipore Corporation (Bedford, MA, USA).
Catalyst Preparation Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), having a Y/Zr molar ratio of 0.11, was prepared by homogeneous precipitation. Zirconyl (Sigma Aldrich, 99%, St. Louis, MO, USA) and yttrium nitrates (Alfa Aesar 99.9%, Haverhill, MA, USA) served as precursors and were precipitated with 1 M sodium hydroxide (Fisher Chemical, >97%, Hampton, NH, USA) following the procedure reported in [30]. The precipitate was filtered, washed, dried at 110 ◦C overnight, and then calcined at 400 ◦C (4 h). To this support, 2% by weight Pt was added by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI), and the catalyst dried (110 ◦C, overnight) and calcined (350 ◦C, 4 h). The prepared material was promoted with different sodium loadings (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2.5 wt.%) by IWI of Na(NO3) solution (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%, Haverhill, MA, USA). Finally, the catalysts were dried at 110 ◦C (overnight) and re-calcined (300 ◦C, 3 h). The samples were sieved to 63 µm < j < 106 µm for catalyst testing.
Materials preparation A series of perovskite-type oxides with the general formula of LaCo1-x-yPdxZnyO3±ı were synthesized by the amorphous citrate method [16,17]. Briefly, metal nitrates precursors were dissolved in deionized water and then citric acid was added in a metal to citric acid molar ratio of 1:1. The resulting solution was carefully evaporated in a rotary evaporator at 70 ◦C and dried overnight at 80 ◦C in a vacuum oven. The obtained solid foam-like material was subjected to calcination at 800 ◦C for 2 h in synthetic air. With this method, perovskite-type oxides with 5, 15 and 25% Co substitution by Pd and Zn at 1:1 molar ratio were synthesized. For comparative purposes, reference materials LaCoO3±ı (LCO), LaCo0.873Pd0.127O3±ı (LCPO) and LaCo0.89Zn0.11O3±ı (LCZO) were also synthesized. For the sake of simplicity, materials composition is abbreviated. For example, LCPZO-15 indicates the presence of La, Co, Pd and Zn oxides, while the number specifies the degree of Co substitution with both Pd and Zn (at 1:1 molar ratio).
Firstly, a FeCrAl alloy foil calcined at 900 °C for 10 h was impregnated with a self-made Al2O3 slurry, lifted and pulled evenly, and dried in air and calcined at 500 °C. Subsequently, a solution of PdCl2-Zn(NO3)2 with a set concentration of Pd (Pd/Zn molar ratio was 0.24) was deposited on the FeCrAl alloy foil. After drying at 120 °C and calcination at 350 °C for 3 h, the metal wall-coated PdZn methanol steam reforming catalyst with the content of Pd relative to Al2O3 of 9.25% was obtained. This was named PdZn/Al2O3/FeCrAl. At the same time, a reference pellet catalyst was prepared by the incipient impregnation method and named PdZn/Al2O3. The support was Al2O3 pellet of 16–18 mesh.
Experimental The catalysts used were several Group 8–10 metals, such as Co, Ni, Ru, Pd, Ir and Pt, supported on various metal oxides i.e. ZnO, In2O3; Ga2O3; SiO2; MgO; ZrO2; CeO2; Al2O3; active carbon (AC), Ta2O5 and HfO2: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the metal oxides with a solution of the corresponding metal salts at 353 K. For comparison, Cu/ZnO was also prepared by an impregnation method with a solution of Cu(NO3)2 and ZnO. Metal loading of each catalyst was kept at 10 wt% unless otherwise stated. The catalysts thus prepared were then dried at 383 K overnight, pressed into granules in sizes of 60–80 meshes (Tyler meshes), and were subjected to calcination in air at 773 K for 3 h. The catalysts (1.0 g) were then packed in a reactor and calcined again at 773 K for 2 h in a stream of O2 (20 vol% O2) diluted with nitrogen at a total flow rate of 100 cm3 STP/min. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were reduced in a hydrogen stream (4 vol% H2) diluted with nitrogen under temperature-programmed conditions at a heating rate of 5 K/min. The reduction temperatures of the supported Group 8–10 metals and Cu/ZnO catalysts were 773 and 523 K, respectively.
The supported Pd catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of acetone-diluted Pd(AcO)2 (Sigma 99.97% Pd) onto pure zinc and cerium oxides, as well as on a composite of both oxides, at room temperature (RT). 2 wt% Pd was added to the pure ZnO, CeO2, and the ZnO–CeO 2 composite. After vacuum drying (333 K, 2 h), the impregnated supports were decomposed in the glass reactor using synthetic air, heating from 298 to 673 K at 3 K/min and then holding 673 K for 2 h.
The sample was successively impregnated with an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 Æ xH2O; the loading of palladium was fixed to 1% and 2% w/w respectively. The samples were calcined at 623 K and reduced with hydrogen (40 ml/min) at 673 K for 2 h (heating rate of 5 K/min). The obtained catalysts were identified as HTZAPd1, HTZAPd2.
2.1 Aerosol synthesis of mixed oxide powders The Pd Zn mixed oxide powders were synthesized using the aerosol method as described by Peterson et al. [8]. Four precursor solutions were prepared by mixing Pd nitrate solution (Sigma Aldrich #380040) containing 4.5- wt% Pd in 10-wt% nitric acid with ZnO powder (Sigma Aldrich #204951) at atomic Pd:Zn ratios of 100:0, 73:27, 59:41 and 39:61. The 10-wt% nitric acid solution was atomized via a Walgreen ultrasonic humidifier by immersing a Nalgene bottle into the water reservoir. The droplets produced were carried through a 2.54 cm O.D. 80 cm quartz tube by a vacuum pump attached at the end of the quartz tube. The quartz tube was positioned inside a three-zone 80 cm tube furnace (600 °C, 700 °C, 600 °C). The droplets within the furnace went through various drying steps with the final product deposited on a heated Teflon filter (80 °C). The aerosol system was operated until approximately 90% of the solution was expended. The deposited powder was removed from the filter and underwent a heat treatment in 100 sccm of flowing air at 200 °C for 2 hours to decompose any residual nitrates.
Experimental Al2O3 supported Pd–ZnO catalysts were prepared using a onestep co-impregnation method. Specifically, a concentrated palladium nitrate solution (20.19 wt% Pd, Engelhard Corp.) was mixed with Zn(NO3)26H2O (99.5%, Aldrich) at 60 8C. A neutral g-Al2O3 support (Engelhard Corp.) with a BET surface area of 230 m2 g1 was pre-calcined at 500 8C for 2 h and kept at 110 8C prior to the incipient-wetness impregnation step. The support was impregnated at 60 8C with an appropriate amount of the pre-mixed Pd and Zn nitrate solution to obtain the final products with various Pd loadings (7.3–13.2 wt%) and Pd/Zn molar ratios (0.25–0.76) while keeping the total weight percentage of Pd and Zn constant (25 wt%). The wet sample was kept at 60 8C for 1 h before drying in air at 110 8C overnight. The dried sample was then calcined at 350 8C for 3 h. For comparison purposes, a commercial LTS CuZnAl catalyst and Pt-metal-based WGS catalyst were also studied.
Monometallic 4 wt % Pd/ZrO2 was also prepared by wet impregnation for comparison purposes. A solution of a calculated amount of Pd(O2CCH3)2 was prepared with chloroform; then the appropriate amount of the ZrO2 support was added to the solution. The impregnated samples were dried overnight at 120 C, and calcined for 1 h in O2 atmosphere before being annealed in H2 flow for 2 h at 400 C.
Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation using commercial g-Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, La2O3 and CeO2 as catalyst support. The Pt and In2O3 co-supported catalysts were prepared through impregnating the above catalyst supports with H2PtCl6 and In(NO3)3 aqueous solution, kept static at room temperature for 12 h, and then dried at 120 C overnight, finally calcined at 400 C for 2.0 h in Air. Pt or In2O3 mono-supported catalysts were synthesized by the same above method except that impregnating the catalyst supports with the corresponding H2PtCl6 or In(NO3)3 aqueous solution. The obtained catalysts were denoted as xA/yB/ MOx, where A and B refer to different metals while x and y refer to the corresponding loading amount (wt.%), and MOx refer to supports (g-Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, La2O3 and CeO2). The loading amounts of Pt and In2O3 co- or mono-supported catalysts were fixed at 1.0 wt% for Pt and 3.0 wt% for In2O3.
2.1. Catalyst Preparation. The (CeO2)0.8(Sm2O3)0.2 (CS) support was prepared by ball-milling CeO2 and Sm2O3 for 24 h. 99.9% purity CeO2 (Aldrich) and Sm2O3 (Acros Organics) were used. A fraction of the support material was calcined by heating in air to 800 C over 5 h and maintaining the material at this temperature for 2 h, while the other was calcined by heating to 1000 C in 10 h and maintaining this temperature for 5 h. The calcination temperatures were chosen to promote solid state reaction. Two 2 wt % loaded Pd catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the supports calcined at 800 and 1000 C (named Pd/CS-800 and Pd/CS-1000, respectively). Aqueous solutions of H2PdCl4 (pH 1) of appropriate concentration were used. After impregnation, the catalyst precursors were dried overnight at room temperature, then at 120 C for 2 h and calcined at 400 C for a further 2 h. The heating rate was 100 C h-1. The activation of the catalysts was carried out by reduction using a 20% H2/He stream at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min-1 (STP).
Conventional Pt/ZnO, Pt/Al2O3, Pd/ZnO, Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with 1 wt% metal were also prepared for comparison purposes by wet impregnation of ZnO or Al2O3 with aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and (NH3)4Pd(NO3)2, respectively. The dried powders were calcined in air at 773 K for 6 h using a heating ramp of 3 K min1.
